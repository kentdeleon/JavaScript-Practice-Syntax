/*OBJECT Method */

/*

An object method is a property that contains a function definition.

Use the following syntax to access an object method.

objectName.methodName()

As you already know, document.write() outputs data. The write() function is actually a method of the document object.

document.write("This is some text") //This is some text

//Note: Methods are functions that are stored as object properties
